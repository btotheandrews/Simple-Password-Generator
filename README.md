# Simple Password Generator
 
This is a simple password generator, that is implemented via Python and runs on the desktop.

It copies generated passwords to your clipboard, and there is a minimum 56.2 bits of entropy with this generator!

I found that a lot of password generators only generated up to 128 characters, so I wanted to make my own that bypasses that limit - even if it is infeasible.
